This app was created using React and Firebase.

The idea was to create an app for users who are looking to purchase plants but may have pets at home.
Some plants are extremely toxic to pets so this would filter those plants out and not recommened them for users who own pets.
On user selection a random plant is generated and shows an image, sunlight levels, water levels, temperature levels and a fact about the plant.

Currently the database is small as it was for a project but I'd love to add to it over time!

I hope you enjoy :)
